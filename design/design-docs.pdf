Name of site: Salt City Photography 
Description of your design concept: My design concept is to provide a clean and  minimalist layout so users can focus
on the photography. I think added designs make sites look cheap and are distracting. I understand that 3-D animations are growing
more popular, but I don't think that it will work with a photogaphy business. 
Sites I looked to as inspiration and comparable businesses are:
